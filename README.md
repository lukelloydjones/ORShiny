Shiny app source code for odds ratio mapping

App is currently being served at http://cnsgenomics.com/shiny/LMOR/

The server.R and ui.R contain the relevant Shiny components for the app.

The shiny_lmor_func.R contains the function that performs the mapping and 
is based on the paper in Genetics titled 

"Transformation of summary statistics from linear mixed model association on all-or-none traits to odds ratio".

It's great you should check out the paper at https://doi.org/10.1534/genetics.117.300360.
It's open access!

Please see app. for instructions on how to use the method.
